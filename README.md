Run 'twoInputs.py' with one command line argument. The argument is an non-negative integer number (e.g., 0) which defines the seed of random number generator. Each seed corresponds to one random network realization. The default maximum value of the argument is set to 1 (i.e., two random network realizations can be generated). This can be changed by changing the 'repeat' variable in 'twoInputs.py'.
